# Hypercube summary (canon spec v3)

Condensed notes from the internal doc: **DLOG / Omega Physics / Golden Wallet / Game / Solar System / Land / Airdrop / Filesystem / Corp Stack - Canon Spec v3**.

## Meta layers
- NPC layer uses mainstream physics (seconds, meters, m/s, m/s^2) only when explicitly asked.
- Omega layer is default: attention-driven time, phi as the core constant, base-8 rhythms.

## Coin, identity, and Golden Wallet Stack
- DLOG is for self-investment and play, not fear-based scarcity.
- Login via Apple or Google with biometrics; keys stay in device keystores; servers see signatures only. No seed phrases for normal users; SMS is never the only factor for critical moves.
- Backing comes from three golden rivers (XAUT, BTC, DOGE) spread across 256 keys each; stored in an Infinity Bank with a Double Infinity Shield. Luke is lore-level wealthy; focus is safe sharing.

## Monetary policy
- Holder interest ~61.8% APY; miner inflation ~8.8248% APY; combined ~70% yearly expansion with per-block phi factors.
- Blocks are attention cycles (humans can approximate ~8s). Supply is intentionally expansive.

## VORTEX, COMET, labels
- Genesis: 88,248 wallets. Seven VORTEX wells plus one COMET hot wallet at the top.
- Labels map to phone numbers off-chain; each label is an Omega root with its own key.
- Miners pay a small tithe that fills COMET to its phi target; overflow goes into VORTEX wells.

## Filesystem
- Universe encoded via a 9∞ master root. Each block unfolds and refolds state.
- Per-label files use semicolon-delimited segments; dots are avoided in filenames and contents.

## Airdrops and gifts
- Airdrop amounts decay on a phi curve. Anti-farm: one per phone, per Apple/Google ID, and per public IP; VPN/datacenter IPs blocked.
- Gifts lock for ~17 days; after day 18, sending unlocks on a phi-shaped curve.

## Land and game feel
- Hollow planets (Earth, Moon, Mars, Sun) with shell/core inversion teleports.
- Lock tiers: iron, gold, diamond, emerald; inactivity ~256 real days triggers auto-auction.
- Movement blends Minecraft sandbox with CS:GO bhop/surf tuned by phi exponents per planet.
- Paper servers act as blank pages per client: void worlds with barrier bounds, ready to host per-rail shards while the central brain paints state and timeline overlays.

## Hosting and rails
- Each static IP is eight Omega rails; scaling adds rails (attention lanes).
- Rust-first workspace: spec/corelib/core/api as anchors. `refold.command` reshapes the tree; `dlog.command` runs the API.
